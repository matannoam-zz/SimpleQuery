## Setting up development environment
It is always recommended to use a virtual environment for each Python appplication.
Create the environment once, after cloning this repository to your machine.
```
python3 -m venv .env
```
For each terminal session going forward, work on the virtual environment and use
its copy of python
```
source .env/bin/activate
```
